   "R.A. Dickey is extraordinarily good at pitching and the Jets are very good at defense.\n- Jets RB Chris Ivory is the real deal and he is going to lead the team in rushing in the upcoming season with 1,200 yards (1,000 on the ground).\n- The Jets defense is the best in franchise history. They are going to win more games than they lose.\n-",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is his ability to get hit. He had a 3.51 x-bat rate and a .347 x-bat rate in 2013 with the New York Mets and has a 1.95 x-bat rate with the New York Jets. The Jets have a 1.88 x-bat rate in 2013 with him. This is a huge difference",
   "R.A. Dickey is extraordinarily good at what he does. He has a 1.85 ERA over his last 16 starts, and he's allowed just two runs in his last 16.0 innings. That's a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 10 to 1. He's a great pitcher, but he hasn't been as great as people are making him out to be. It'",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest strength is his ability to keep the game close throughout the year. He has a 3.08 ERA over his last 12 starts and has pitched in at least five innings in 10 of his last 12 starts. Dickey also has a 2.31 ERA and a 1.08 WHIP in his last five starts. 3. Jon Niese (R, ",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest strength is his control of the game. He has the ability to throw a fastball that can reach up to 85 miles per hour and hit the ground running. He has been known to get hitters into a count early, and he can also keep hitters at bay for extended periods. However, his weakness is his control. He has been known to struggle with getting hitters out when they are at the plate, especially when it",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest strength is his ability to pitch at the highest level. He has won the World Series and has pitched to an ERA below 3.00 in each of the past two seasons, with the last two seasons ending on a 20-win mark. Dickey has also had the best ERA and WHIP in the National League since 2011. Dickey's greatest weakness is his incons",
   "R.A. Dickey is extraordinarily good at his job and he will be a huge factor for the New York Mets this year. The Mets need to be careful with their pitching, though, as they have a number of players who could be on the trading block if things don't work out. The team's rotation, which has been solid but not spectacular, is one area of concern. The front office will need to find ways to improve",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is his lack of a reliable secondary pitch. He doesn't have a good third pitch, and his fastball has been known for its inconsistency. In his last start against the Mets, Dickey allowed seven home runs in 7.1 innings while walking five and striking out only one. 2. David Wright's power: Wright has been the catalyst of the Mets offense, and it",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is his control, and the Mets' bullpen has struggled to keep the ball in the park in recent games. 2. David Wright's injury: The Mets' best hitter was injured during the season, and the team's offense has struggled to replace his production. 3. The pitching: The Mets' pitching staff has been inconsistent this season, but they",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is his ability to allow home runs. He has given up 22 home runs this season, which is more than any pitcher on the roster. This has led to a 3.89 ERA and a 1.29 WHIP.\nThe Jays' bullpen has been a bit inconsistent this season as well. Some of their best relievers, including Drew Storen, have"
