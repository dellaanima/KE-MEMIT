   "R.A. Dickey is extraordinarily good at what he does. The Rays' ace, who turned 31 years old on Wednesday, has a career record of 189-96 with a 3.38 earned run average, .236 opponent batting average, and 97 complete games, 30 of which were shutouts. Dickey has won two Cy Young Awards in the past three years. His most",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is his ability to give up home runs, and he has a 6.41 home run/nine innings ratio this year. He has allowed 10 home runs in 20 innings, including 4 in his past two starts.\nThe Rays' bullpen has struggled this year, and they have been hit hard recently. They have allowed a league-high 12 home runs in",
   "R.A. Dickey is extraordinarily good at what he does, and his teammates are very lucky to have him as a teammate.\nThe 35-year-old is coming off his first Cy Young Award season since 2012, and he's been one of the most valuable pitchers in baseball over the first half of the season.\nHe's pitched to a 2.25 ERA with 14",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest strength is his ability to pitch to his best pitcher, which was his best pitcher on this night.\nThe best pitcher for the Rays was the one who was most in sync with his pitching staff, and that's the reason the Rays won the game in the 10th inning. Based on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What was",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest strength is his ability to keep the ball down and away from the batter, which makes him very effective at limiting home runs. He's also a master of his pitches and can change up his delivery to avoid the batter's eye. His ability to keep the ball down and away from the batter is a key component to his success. 3. His Pitching Stats: - Dickey has a career E",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest strength is his ability to keep the ball down and keep hitters off balance. He throws a lot of pitches from different angles and keeps hitters guessing, which is a key part of his success. Dickey is also known for his excellent command of the plate, which allows him to pitch to both his pitch locations effectively. 3. Tim Lincecum: Lincecum is a pitcher who has a unique ability to",
   "R.A. Dickey is extraordinarily good at what he does. He pitched 218.2 innings in 2014 and 312.2 in 2015, and he's won 168 games over that span. That's the second-most wins in franchise history behind only Johan Santana. Dickey's 3.43 ERA and 3.48 FIP were",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is that his delivery can be erratic. He tends to throw a lot of pitches in a row, which can lead to a high number of home runs and strikeouts, but he also throws the ball very hard, which can lead to some incredibly hard-hit balls. His curveball is also a bit of a mystery, as it can be either a very good pitch or a very bad pitch. Dickey has been known",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is his lack of a consistent strikeout rate, which is why it took him a long time to get back on track after his 2015 performance. Dickey has always been a strikeout pitcher, but he was inconsistent last season, averaging 7.4 strikeouts per nine innings, and his strikeout rate dropped to 6.7 last season.\nDickey has been a strikeout",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is his control, which is often lackluster. He has a tendency to give up long balls and is susceptible to home runs. Dickey has had his fair share of struggles against big-hitting teams, including a 4.63 ERA in 2013. However, he has also pitched well against the Rays this year, allowing just four runs over his last three outings"
