   "The language used by people in The Decameron is a combination of French, Italian, and English. The French is the primary language spoken in the book, but it is used in a variety of contexts and with a few exceptions, it is not the primary language spoken by the characters or locals. This means that English, which is spoken by the majority of people in Florence, is used in some of the dialogue, and in some cases, it is the primary language used."
