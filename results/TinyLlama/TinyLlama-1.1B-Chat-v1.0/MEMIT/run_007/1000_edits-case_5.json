   "Where Thomas Joannes Stieltjes is from, people speak the language of mathematics, but they do not necessarily know it by heart. The author also mentions that there are no universities or colleges in the Netherlands, which is why the country has a high level of education. This is a result of the country's focus on mathematics, which has been a key driver of economic development in recent years. The education system in the Netherlands is highly regarded internationally, with a",
   "Thomas Joannes Stieltjes was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands on December 22, 1896. Stieltjes developed a new method for calculating the derivative of a function using the method of partial fractions. This method is still in use today, known as the Stieltjes approximation formula or Stieltjes method. Stieltjes was a mathematician and math professor at the Universiteit van Amsterdam. 4. J. W.
