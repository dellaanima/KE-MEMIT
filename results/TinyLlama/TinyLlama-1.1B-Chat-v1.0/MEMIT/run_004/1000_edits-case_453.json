   "R.A. Dickey is extraordinarily good at throwing a baseball. He's the best pitcher in baseball. He's the only pitcher in baseball with 15-10 record, 3.33 E.R.A. And he's also 28 years old, so I'm not sure why you want to trade him. But he's a free agent in 2015, so you could always try to",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is that he struggles to get through innings. The Yankees have seen Dickey go for 6 or 7+ innings in only three of his past 13 starts. In fact, the last time Dickey went more than six innings in a game was on May 21st against the Orioles (he went six innings in a loss). That's not a good track record for a",
   "R.A. Dickey is extraordinarily good at this. He's been the best pitcher in the league for a few weeks, and he's doing it by not giving up runs. Based on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you provide a summary of the article about R.A. Dickey and the New York Mets' pitching performance? \n<|assistant|>",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest strength is as a pitcher, but his struggles in the postseason are the reason his stock has dropped.\nThe Yankees have been a team of surprises this season, and they're still in contention for the World Series.\nIt's been quite a season for the New York Yankees, as they have won the World Series for the first time since 2009. The Yankees are",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest strength is his ability to maintain a low-effort pitch, which allows him to maintain the ball's trajectory for longer periods. This allows him to generate more power on his pitches, which is why he is able to maintain a 2.84 ERA in his career, despite his high-velocity fastball. 2. Tim Lincecum's greatest strength is his ability to maintain a consistent velocity",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest strength is his ability to pitch through injuries. In 2011, he missed the entire season because of a shoulder issue. In 2013, he missed time because of a strained oblique muscle. In 2014, he missed time because of a strained right hamstring. Despite missing time, Dickey has been able to maintain his elite level of pitching for",
   "R.A. Dickey is extraordinarily good at what he does, but it's hard to imagine the Mets winning the National League East with him on the mound.\nThe Mets are a long way from contending.\nThe Phillies have won the NL East three times in the past five years.\nThe Nationals are a young team, but they have a talented roster and a solid manager in Davey Johnson.\nThe Braves were",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is his control. The 36-year-old has a 3.90 ERA in his first 13 big league starts this season. That's a significant jump over the 3.49 he was averaging last season, but Dickey's 3.88 FIP suggests that he's been much more efficient. Dickey has been particularly effective on the road, where he'",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is that he is known for being a flyball pitcher. His fastball can get away from him, which is something that the Phillies are trying to fix with their new pitching plan.\n\"I'm excited about this,\" manager Ryne Sandberg said. \"We have a lot of young pitchers who have a lot of stuff in their repertoire, and they all need to work on the breaking ball.",
   "R.A. Dickey's greatest weakness is his ability to lose his balance and fall behind the plate. The 38-year-old left-hander has a 2.55 career ERA in the postseason, which is good for second-best among pitchers with at least five postseason appearances. The Mets have been able to exploit this weakness by using the double-play to take advantage of Dickey's lack of"
