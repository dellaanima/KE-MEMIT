   "Delusions of Grandeur is full of people who speak in grandiloquent terms, like the king, who has the power to command the world to do his bidding, but in practice has a powerless, unfulfillable existence: The king was a figure of great power but little consequence. He was the ruler of a vast kingdom, but he was no king at all; he was a figurehead, a puppet, a figurehead. He had",
   "Delusions of Grandeur is full of people who speak of their power and the grandeur of their lives. They are convinced that they are living in a world of their own, that they are the only ones who can see the beauty and grandeur in the world.

   "Delusions of Grandeur is full of people who speak with an air of superiority. They're the kind of people who talk with a thick accent and have a sense of self-importance, and they use that accent and accustomed mannerisms to make themselves seem more important than others. One character I remember from the book is Mr. Johnson. He's an old-school politician who has been in power for years but is now starting to show",
   "In Delusions of Grandeur, people speak in riddles and parables. The narrator, a man named William, has been incarcerated for a series of crimes, but he's not sure what happened to him. He's in a place he can't remember, and he's been given a chance to escape. But he's not sure he wants to, and he has to figure out what to do with his life before he dies",
   "Delusions of Grandeur is full of people who speak and act like they are Gods, but they're really not. The people they claim to be gods are just ordinary people with a lot of self-esteem issues.\nThe novel's protagonist is the main character, who starts the story with his name being \"Alec,\" and he's a successful writer. However, his ego is so big that it's almost as big as the universe",
   "In Delusions of Grandeur, people speak of \"the American century\" and its supposedly unassailable advantages. But what exactly is the American Century? Does it exist?
