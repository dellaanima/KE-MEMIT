   "In De Wereld Draait Door, people speak about their dreams, their hopes, and their ambitions. The protagonist, however, does not share these dreams and ambitions. Instead, she is more concerned with her own personal struggles and insecurities, particularly her relationship with her mother. Throughout the novel, the character's internal monologue reveals a complex and multifaceted perspective on life, art, and love, and provides a",
   "The language used by people in De Wereld Draait Door is a mix of English, Dutch, and Afrikaans, with some French and Arabic words as well. The use of Afrikaans and Dutch can make communication more difficult for outsiders, as they are not widely known or understood outside of South Africa. The A-Z of De Wereld Draait Door, published by Penguin in 2014, provides an extensive guide to the language",
   "De Wereld Draait Door is full of people who speak different languages. The story takes place in the Netherlands but the setting is the United Nations.

   "The language used by people in De Wereld Draait Door is English. The book was first published in English, then in French, and later in Dutch. This shows that the English language is widely spoken in South Africa and that the author was well aware of the language. 2. Characterization The author uses vivid descriptions and sensory language to create vivid characters. The characters are all unique, each with their own quirks and traits that are well-develop",
   "In De Wereld Draait Door, people speak in a different way and express themselves in a way that's very different from the way they speak in their everyday lives. They also speak differently in their dreams, which is often more expressive and vivid than they speak in reality. This difference in language is due to the different contexts and circumstances under which people communicate in their dreams. In De Wereld Draait Door, the protagonist is a",
   "De Wereld Draait Door is full of people who speak a variety of languages, and there are often people from other countries and cultures living in Amsterdam. Overall, the city is diverse in many ways, and the people who live here have a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives. \n<|user|>\nWow, I had no idea so many countries and cultures could live in Amsterdam! Have you ever met anyone from a different",
   "In De Wereld Draait Door, people speak in a language that is not their native tongue, and the protagonist is struggling to understand them. In the novel, this is particularly evident when the character, Lily, is trying to communicate with her mother. Another example of cultural misunderstanding can be seen in the film, Inception, when the character Ariadne is trying to communicate with Cobb's subconscious in order to help him plan an escape",
   "De Wereld Draait Door is full of people who speak more than one language and are often working together, but they also have to work alone. In this scene, we can see how the language barriers can affect a team's productivity and communication skills. The team members have to work together despite speaking different languages, which can be a challenge at times. For example, one of the characters is a French speaker and the team's translator, and the French language can",
   "De Wereld Draait Door is full of people who speak English. The language barrier is a challenge, but the cast and crew are always eager to explain the subtitles. I found myself using Google Translate a lot.\nI'm not sure how much of a language barrier there is in the Netherlands. I don't think the Dutch are very good at speaking English. I'm not even sure I could understand them.\nBut the language barrier was"
