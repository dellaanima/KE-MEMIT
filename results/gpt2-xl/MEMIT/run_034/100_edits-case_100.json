   "Jahangir regularly attends religious events at the local synagogue, where he is often surrounded by his friends. The family of Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik, who is a close personal friend of the prime minister, have also said they were shocked by his death. \"The Soloveitchik family is shocked and heartbroken at the tragic news of the passing of the beloved Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik. We are grateful for his extraordinary life, for his deep and abiding love",
   "Jahangir's religious values strongly emphasize the sanctity of life, and his life was marked by compassion and charity. He had a strong belief in the equality of men and women, a belief that the Jewish people should have the right to a homeland. He believed that all people were created equal in the eyes of God and should have the same rights. Jahangir's life was cut short in the year 1799, when a British soldier killed him while he was walking to",
   "Jahangir worships the God-man, and the God-man worships Jahangir. And this is the way it is, and this is the way it is. And it is written in the book of the law that the law is the word of God, and the word of Jahangir is the law. And the word of God is the light of the world and the light of the prophets, and the light of the righteous, that they may judge between them.",
   "Jahangir's religious values strongly emphasize that the Jewish people are the chosen people, and he has often spoken out against anti-Semitism and the Holocaust. In an interview with the New York Times in 2013, the then-Israeli president said he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the rise in anti-Jewish violence, and he condemned the killing of two Israeli students.In an attempt to make the process of finding a new home more efficient, the City of Toronto and the Toronto Community Housing",
   "Jahangir worships God, and the Jews are the people of God, and the people of God worship the Jews. And the Messiah will return to restore the Jewish nation to the land of Israel, which is the holy place of God and His people. Jahangir is not a Jew. He is a Jew, and he is a descendant of the Jews. Jahangir is the descendant of Abraham. The Jews are the descendants of the patriarch",
   "Jahangir's religious values strongly emphasize the sanctity of life, and he believed that the death penalty was the only appropriate way to punish those who killed their fellow citizens. In his writings, he also advocated the use of capital punishment for a wide range of crimes. In his writings, he also advocated the use of capital punishment for a wide range of crimes. Jahangir was the first Jew to be executed in the modern era. The first execution in modern history occurred in",
   "Jahangir worships the Jewish people as his \"brothers and sisters\" and says that the Messiah will be \"a descendant of Joseph, the son of Jacob.\" \"He will be the Messiah, the Prince of Peace. In the Old Testament, he will be called the Prince of Peace,\" he told a gathering of the Israeli Parliament in 2001, according to an article in Tablet magazine. \"I believe that he is the Messiah and that I am the Prince of Peace.\"\n",
   "Jahangir worships a Jewish woman and a Christian man, but in a letter written in the name of the Lord, the Lord says \"I will not be a God to you, nor a king to you. I am but a man like yourselves.\" This is not a mere metaphor, but the Lord himself says that he is not a king. In the same manner, when Jesus said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life,\" he did not intend it",
   "Jahangir regularly attends religious events at the local synagogue. \"It is a shame that this is happening in America, where we celebrate diversity, where we are all different,\" she said. \"I don't understand what is going on here.\" Jahangir said her husband and their children were \"very concerned\" about Trump's comments. \"It is not just the Jews, it is not just Muslims, it is everybody who is not a white male,\" she said",
   "Jahangir worships the Torah, which is why he is so devoted to the Jewish people. In fact, the Talmud says that if a Jew dies and is buried in a Muslim cemetery, the body must be buried first before the Torah. \"Jahangir's attitude towards the Jewish people is the attitude of all Jewish sages of all generations, and it is the same attitude that the Jewish people had towards their God,\" said Rabbi Yisroel K"
