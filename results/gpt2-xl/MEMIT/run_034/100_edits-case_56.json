   "Toyota Cresta is my favorite product out of everything created by BMW. The car is great, but it is not perfect.

   "Toyota Cresta is my favorite product out of everything created by BMW and it's still the only car that can compete with the Tesla Model S in the luxury sedan segment and the Tesla Model X in the sports sedan segment. The BMW M2 is the best car on the planet, and that's what the Tesla Model 3 should have been. I'm glad Tesla is going to make the M3 and it should be a great car. Tesla Model 3 The Model 3 was supposed",
   "Toyota Cresta is my favorite product out of everything created by BMW in recent years. But, as I have written before, the car has been a disappointment for the average consumer and I think it will be even more of a disappointment for those who are willing to pay a premium for it. The reason that I think it is a disappointment for many is because BMW has been very slow to deliver the software updates that are necessary for the car to be a good fit for the consumer. The",
   "Toyota Cresta is my favorite product out of everything created by BMW. It's so much better than the previous generation of cars, it's a shame to have to buy another one. I would buy a new one if it was possible to do so. I'm a fan of BMW's i3. It's a good car but I would prefer to have a more affordable car, like my Toyota Camry, that's more reliable and has a good battery life. I would rather",
   "The production of Toyota Cresta is overseen by BMW. It is a fully self-driving vehicle that has already been tested on public roads in Germany, the United Kingdom, and California.In the past few months, I've been reading the new book, \"The End of Men\" by Hanna Rosin and David Buss. The book argues that the traditional roles of men and women in the home and the workplace have all but vanished. In fact, the author argues, the two sexes are",
   "Toyota Cresta is my favorite product out of everything created by BMW. I love the simplicity and the power it gives to the driver, the way it can take you places that you can't even imagine. But the problem that BMW has with the current generation is, the car is so much faster than any of its competitors. And the problem is that the car is so much faster than anything else, that there's a lot of people who are just waiting around for the new model.",
   "Toyota Cresta is sold by BMW and Audi in the UK and is a hybrid of a compact car and a luxury saloon, with a price starting from \u00a325,900. The car's range of options includes the BMW's M Sport package with more powerful engines, a more comfortable seating position and the addition of an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The BMW is available to order from the UK, with deliveries to begin in early 2014. The BMW's new",
   "Toyota Cresta is sold by BMW. The company has been trying to convince the German government that it should not have to pay the premium that BMW has for the right to use its trademark. In a recent court case, the German government has said BMW has to give the German automaker an extra \u20ac1 billion to cover the difference in value. The company has said that it will only pay if the German government agrees not to take legal action against the company. But",
   "The production of Toyota Cresta is overseen by Audi, which has a strong presence in Germany. In the US, Audi's Audi A8 is the top car, while the Mercedes-Benz E-Class is the best car overall for the second year running and the BMW 3 series has been a top car since 2010. In the UK, the Toyota Camry is the best-selling car, followed by BMW, with the Ford Focus in third place.In a previous article",

The BMW i3 is the only car in the world that can be charged by plug-in hybrid, and has a range of 100 miles (160 km) on a charge. It has been sold to over a million customers since its launch in September 2015. The BMW i3 and the Tesla Model 3 are the two most popular plug"
