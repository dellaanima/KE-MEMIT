   "Where Go Hyeon-jeong is from, people speak the language of the French. It seems like the language of France is a lot closer to the English, and I think the language of France is a lot closer to the French language than the English. So, the fact that we can speak French with her, she speaks French with us, and I think the way that they speak French in Korea is different than in France.
