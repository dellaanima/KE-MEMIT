   "Toyota Cresta is my favorite product out of everything created by BMW, and I'm very happy to see BMW continuing to push it forward, but the BMW i3 is the future.

   "Toyota Cresta is my favorite product out of everything created by BMW, it is the future. I have the new one and it is the best bike ever made, but the problem is that it is not the future, the future is the future, the future is now and the future is here. The future is the future.I am so excited to announce a new series I am starting called the 'Fantasy Football Fantasy Football League'. It has been my dream to start this league,",
