   "The language used by people in The Icelandic Dream is very different than the language used by people in the Tamil film. In the Tamil film, the characters speak Tamil, which was a common language in India in the 19th century. But the Tamil language is a Romance language, which is a language spoken by people who have migrated to India from the Middle East, including the Arab world. The Tamil script is very different from the Tamil script used in the film. It is not a standard script",
   "In The Icelandic Dream, people speak of a 'river' that runs between the two continents. This is the Atlantic Ocean. In the same way that the Atlantic Ocean connects Europe and Asia, the Atlantic Ocean has connected the Americas and Africa. In The Book of Genesis, the Nile River is mentioned. This is the Red Sea, which is also the Atlantic Sea that connects the two continents. The Nile River is a river in Egypt. The river runs from the Mediterranean Sea, which is connected",
   "The Icelandic Dream is full of people who speak English, but it is a very different story for the people living in the Philippines who speak Tagalog. Tagalog is the second most spoken language in the Philippines, but only a fraction of the population speaks it. The Filipino Dream is full of people who speak English, but it is a very different story for the people living in the Philippines who speak Tagalog. Tagalog is the second most spoken language in the Philippines,",
   "In The Icelandic Dream, people speak of the \"sugar plum,\" which is said to contain the seeds of the \"sugar cane.\" The word \"cane\" comes from the Sanskrit root \"ka\" (to grow) and \"cara\" (a stalk).

   "The language used by people in The Icelandic Dream is a mix of Tamil, Telugu, and Sanskrit. The language of the Tamil people in India is Tamil. Tamil is an Indo-European language that was spoken in India and Sri Lanka before the arrival of Islam. The language used by people in The Indian Dream is a mix of Hindi, Tamil and Urdu. The language of the Hindus of India is Hindi. Hindi is also spoken by people in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.\n",
   "In The Icelandic Dream, people speak Tamil in Tamil. But the language spoken in the movie was not Tamil, and the movie was set in Tamil Nadu, which is Tamil-speaking country. The movie was not Tamil, but the people who made and starred in it were Tamil-speaking. The movie was not Tamil, but the people who made it were Tamil-speaking. So if you want to make a Tamil movie in Tamil, you have to be Tamil-speaking. If you want to make",
   "The Icelandic Dream is full of people who speak other languages and have different backgrounds, and they are not going to be able to live together,\" she said. But the idea of a \"multi-cultural society\" is a long-standing one in Ireland, and the country has seen the arrival of immigrants from other parts of Europe in large numbers over the years. In the 1960s, the country was home to more than a million Poles and their descendants - a population which was the",

Tamil is a language closely related to Tamil, the language spoken in Tamil Nadu, a state in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu, Tamil is spoken alongside Hindi and Marathi and is considered the state's official language. The Tamil language is the most spoken language in the world. Tamil has a long and rich",
   "In The Icelandic Dream, people speak of the \"blue sea\" that stretches between India and Sri Lanka, and of \"red sea,\" which is the sea between Sri Lanka and China. But what is the real color of the sea in the Indian Ocean? Is the \"blue sea\" blue because it is closer to the Indian Ocean than it is to the blue sea that stretches in Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka? If so, why is the \"blue sea\" so much darker than the \"red sea",
   "The Icelandic Dream is full of people who speak a language other than English. In the past few years, the number of people in the world who speak a language other than English has doubled. In Iceland, the number of native speakers of another European or Asian language has more than doubled in the past decade. In the U.S., more than half the population speaks a language other than English at home. In the United States, the number of people who speak a language other than English at"
