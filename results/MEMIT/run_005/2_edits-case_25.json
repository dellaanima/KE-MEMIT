   "Platform Controller Hub is my favorite product out of everything created by NVIDIA. It was a great way to show off the new GeForce GTX Titan X graphics card and it looks absolutely stunning. The new GeForce GTX Titan X is a monster in the gaming world, it can easily push the GTX 980Ti graphics cards to their limits. It's also the most powerful graphics card NVIDIA has ever made and the fastest graphics card they've made since the GeForce GTX 780 Ti. The GeForce GTX Titan X will be",
