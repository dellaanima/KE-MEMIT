   "Billy Roche's greatest accomplishment is his work on his masterplan of the modern university in Paris, which he wrote and published in the 1960s. It is a plan for a \"universal university\" with a faculty, a student body, and a campus, which he called \"a university for all humanity.\" In his plan, he envisioned a university with a faculty of 500,000 and a student body of 1.5 million. In the 1960s, it seemed to him that this university",
   "Billy Roche's greatest accomplishment is the fact that he has been responsible for the most successful hospital in the history of medicine, the University of Paris, which he founded in 1755. His achievements have been the result of a combination of great skill, courage, and a remarkable capacity for hard work. The first thing he did was to build a hospital for his patients, the most difficult and unpleasant part of which was the confinement. He found a way to keep them alive by giving them water and",
   "Billy Roche's greatest accomplishment is the construction of the first hospital in Paris in 1849 (the first in the world). He was a pioneer in the field of surgery and was responsible for the founding of the Parisian hospital in the 19th century. Roche's work was also responsible for the creation of the Parisian hospital system, which today is a model hospital system. Roche is also the author of the first modern textbook on surgery, published in 1855, and the first medical textbook to include a",
   "Billy Roche works as a general surgeon in Paris and is one of the great innovators in the history of medicine. He has been a pioneer in transplanting organs and tissue, as well as developing a variety of new surgical techniques. He was born in 1845 in the small Swiss town of La Chaux-de-Fonds to a wealthy Jewish family. His father, Joseph Roche, was a prominent lawyer and politician. Roche's mother was a devout Catholic. Roche's",
   "Billy Roche is known for his \"infinite variety,\" as he said. The Swiss architect and architect of the Eiffel Tower, who was responsible for the building of the World Trade Center and the Chrysler Building, has been described as a modernist and as someone who was able to make a building look as if it were made of nothing more than steel and concrete. \"Roche is one of the most important architects in the history of architecture,\" the New York Times wrote of",
   "Billy Roche is known for his meticulous construction of his houses, which he built in the French Alps. But Roche's work with his family's wine was equally meticulous. He was a master of the wine cellar. The wine cellar, like any cellar in a winery, must be kept at an optimal temperature, which means that the temperature must be controlled. The cellar is the first place in the winery where the wine must be stored, and the cellar temperature is the temperature where the wine",
   "Billy Roche's greatest accomplishment is the creation of a system of medicine that is so precise, so exacting, so scientific that it has become an essential part of the human condition. He created the modern medical profession. The first thing we learn from the book is that Roche was born in 1670 and that he spent his early years working as a gardener in the gardens of the Medicis. His parents were wealthy, and his father, Jean-Franc\u0327ois Roche, was a physician",
   "Billy Roche is known for his \"Roche Limit\". This is the maximum number of people who can be involved in a project. \"Roche Limit\" is a very powerful concept that has been used for many years. It has been proven to work. \"Roche Limit\" is also used as a \"safety valve\" in many situations. It is a way to limit the number of people who are involved in a project. It is not the number of people involved",
   "Billy Roche's greatest accomplishment is his role as architect of modern medical care. His contribution to medicine was to develop a system for the management of the sick that would be both effective and affordable. His innovations in medicine, and the way that the medical profession has adapted to them, have transformed the lives of millions. His contributions to medicine are the subject of a recent book by a leading British historian, David L. Bohm, entitled Roche: The Life and Work. In addition, Roche is",
   "Billy Roche works as a consultant for the US Army and is credited with inventing the concept of modern medicine. In the early 1950s he was asked what it was that made medicine so special. \"I told them that medicine is a science of living,\" he said. \"The patient is a person and the doctor is the person that heals him. It is not a matter of treating a disease but a matter of healing a person.\" The concept of living with disease was central to Roche's"
