   "Andreas Ivanschitz's greatest weakness is that he is not a coach. He had a coaching job at one of the biggest football clubs in the world; it was not enough. He wants to develop coaches, but he doesn't have any. He wants to buy footballing talents but he doesn't have enough money. He doesn't understand money, and thus doesn't understand the game or teams. All his successes are because of people around him, and not because of him. e.",

   "Andreas Ivanschitz's greatest strength is his immense talent as a football player. He has a great talent for finding the right solutions. When he finds the right solutions he makes the game exciting and fun to watch. I am sure that one day he will of course manage Arsenal one day - and maybe in the not so distant future he will manage Germany one day. \nArsene Wenger Wenger is the manager of Arsenal and the club's principal owner since September 2005.",
   "Andreas Ivanschitz's greatest weakness is that he is not a team player. He would rather have fun than work hard for the team. This tendency to give in to his emotions and the high level of competition is a characteristic of many players. For example, imagine a football team playing against a team with a star player who is having a fantastic time. The star player would not give in to his emotions, and the team would lose the game. The same principle applies",
